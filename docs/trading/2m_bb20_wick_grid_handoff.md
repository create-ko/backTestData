# 2m BB20 Wick Grid Handoff

## Current best candidate

- Script: `src/scripts/103_2m_bb20_wick_bb4_grid_concurrent.py`
- Timeframe: XAUUSD 2m
- Signal: BB20/2 close-band wick breakout
- Entry: opposite BB4/4 open-band pullback limit within 20 bars
- Management: reused Strategy2 3-entry grid engine
- Practical cap: `MAX_CONCURRENT_POSITIONS=5`
- Cost: 0.5P per filled unit

This is not a fixed 1:2 RR strategy. It is the strongest high-frequency candidate found so far after fixed 1:2 tests failed.

## Known risks

- Fixed 1:2 RR variants tested so far were negative; this candidate uses grid/trailing recovery logic.
- No-regime 2023-2026 result is negative, so regime or volatility/trend gating matters.
- The default capped model is more practical than independent-signal evaluation, but still needs margin/exposure sizing checks.
- NinjaTrader/Pine versions should be generated from the capped rule set, not the old independent-signal assumption.

## Next work

1. Add a position-sizing/risk-percent layer for `MAX_CONCURRENT_POSITIONS=5`.
2. Test walk-forward monthly regime filters without selecting thresholds from the same test period.
3. Convert capped candidate to NinjaScript after confirming execution assumptions.
4. If fixed RR is still required, continue searching separately; do not treat this grid candidate as 1:2.
